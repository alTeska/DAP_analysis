# DAP neuron inference analysis
The second part of the [DAP model](https://github.com/alTeska/DAPmodel) project at
[Prof. Herz lab for Computational Neuroscience](http://www.neuro.bio.lmu.de/members/comp_neuro_herz/herz_a/index.html) at LMU.
This part of the code is responsible for inference of the data over the DAP model. Here all of the scripts and results can be found. For more details on implementation of the model look to the other repository.

* [Jan-Matthis Lueckmann](https://github.com/jan-matthis) - a lot of files are inspired and built on delfi library models
* [Caroline Fischer](https://github.com/cafischer) - initiating the cell model and writitng the code of which a simplified version is used in dap.cell_fitting
